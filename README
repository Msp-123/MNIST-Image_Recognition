A popular dataset most commonly used on image recognition is MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) called dataset. This dataset 
contains grayscale images, each of which is 28x28 pixels. These pictures are of various people. It was created by hand drawing the numbers between 0 and 9.
In image recognition applications such as estimating the number on a dataset image is used. There are 60000 images in total in the dataset.

In this example, MNIST data is read from the file and a model is created with a two hidden layer neural network. 
When the model is tested, a success rate of around 97% is achieved. Afterwards, an approximation was made with the numbers of 28X28 that I created myself.
Estimation should be done with numbers created in the same way as the training data. "Anti-aliasing" is used in the training data. 
I created the images to be guessed with anti-aliasing using brushes with Microsoft Paint. 

Min-Max scaling was performed on the pixel data before being trained. The Min-Max scaling for data between [0, 255] can actually be created by dividing 
this pixel data by 255. The "overfitting" problem arises when too many epochs are applied to the model. 
For this reason, the number of epochs was determined as 20. 
The 28x28 pixel data is applied in the form of an input with 784 elements, not in a matrix form.
